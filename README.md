### Recent works

**Advancing AI for Regularory Compliance**

🔍 I have had the privilledge to lead an exciting project, focusing on the development of end-to-end, scalable and secure AI solutions for parsing regulatory documents. This work involves using machine learning to simplify the complexities of legal compliance and regulation, aiming to mitigate the risk of financial penalites for my clients.

**Advancing African NLP models with ZaBantu**

🌱 [ZaBantu](https://huggingface.co/dsfsi/zabantu-xlm-roberta): I had the honor to drive the inception of the ZaBantu cross-lingual Language Models in partnership with the [Data Science For Social Impact(DSFSI)](https://dsfsi.github.io/) team. This is a collection of lightweight Masked Language Models trained on South African Bantu languages, with the goal of promoting the richness of South Africa's linguistic heritage and making technology more inclusive.


### Future Aspirations

- **Contributing to Open Source:** Giving back to the tech community by increasing my contributions to open-source projects, acknowledging the contributions of those who paved the way for my journey.

- **Contributing to African AI:** Building high-quality training datasets for African languages to unlock the digital revolution for everyone. I think that breaking language barriers is a key step in enabling more collaboration for Africans to contribute meaningfully to the AI revolution.

- **Establishing Benchmarks for African NLP Models:** To track progress and also highlight achievements in the field of NLP, encouraging further innovation and development.

- **Inspiring the Future Generations**: Sharing knowledge, mentorship and helping my community to develop the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the digital age.

- **Building Impactful Solutions:** Collaborating on localized projects that leverage tech to positively impact developing communities. For example, Self-service Educational platforms, Enterpreneurship platforms, Financial Wellness platforms, etc.
